<h1 class="section-heading centered">Organising: the fundamentals</h1>

What follows is a short introduction to workplace organising, mostly adapted from materials put out by the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). There is training within PCS, currently confined to bite-size courses, that covers some of this – as well as external training offered by the IWW themselves and the Solidarity Federation, neither of which hold back on the direct action aspect which still meets with incredible nervousness within the PCS mainstream.

## AEIOU
In organizing our jobs it is important to talk to our fellow workers. We want to build relationships with them. To do this we have 1 on 1 conversations with them. We talk with them and learn about the issues at work and thus in life that we each care about. Doing this in a structured way makes these conversations more effective.

### Agitate

Agitation ultimately boils down to getting people to question authority. Someone asks, "What are they doing to us? Why are they doing it? Is it right?" Encourage people to ask, "Who is making the decisions, who is being forced to live with the decisions, and why should that be so?" People should not accept a rule or an answer simply because it comes from the authorities, whether that authority be the government, the boss, the union - or you. An effective organiser encourages their fellow workers to think for themselves.

### Educate

Life is not a school room and people do not learn simply by going to meetings or reading leaflets. Most people learn, change, and grow in the process of action. Will you take this leaflet? Will you pass it on to your friend? Will you sign this petition? If you want to develop new organisers, get your colleagues involved in the organising.

### Inoculate

This is just what it sounds like. Giving workers a bit of the “poison” they can expect from management, so they are prepared for it. In part, this means addressing negative propaganda and attempts to discourage union participation, but it also means being ready for a more targeted backlash from that participation. Victimisation of union reps and members does happen, but it can be fought, and the first step is inoculating against the fear.

Inoculation is a two-stage process:
1.	Dealing with fear
a.	Acknowledge fear as legitimate
b.	Assuage fear
2.	Preparing for management response

Remember: inoculation is an ongoing process.

### Organise

Organisation need not be overly formal or structurally top heavy, but it must be there. A telephone tree and a mailing list may be all the organisation that you need, but if those are what you need then you must have them. 

### Unionise (or pUsh)

Pushing is the work of enabling a worker to move from their current state of commitment and activity to a higher state. Most pushing happens in a one-on-one conversation, just as all the rest of AEIOU does.

There’s a staircase from someone who becomes dissatisfied with their conditions at work, to an active, class conscious, revolutionary organizer. Most of us take that staircase one step at a time, with many steps arriving as a result of a push from someone we trust and respect. Even outside the life-changing experiences of taking collective action on the job, little things change people.

## Stages of an organising drive
There are several stages to a successful organising drive. Exactly how each stage runs will vary depending on the workplace, and you should be prepared to be flexible, but following through each stage is important.

### Gathering contacts and mapping

**Physical mapping**

Knowledge is power. Or at least it is the beginning of power. You will want to know everything you can about your workplace and your employer. Workplace “mapping” is one of the most effective ways of examining the strength and weaknesses of your branch. This will be a long term, on-going process of education.

How can we hope to involve people or even have effective two-way communication when we don’t know where they work, who they work with or who is the best person to speak to them? 

And without this information how can we effectively plan and make decisions about workplace, branch, group or national strategy or priorities? 

Mapping is the process of obtaining accurate and relevant information about the workforce in a systematic way. If done properly it can form the basis of successful union activity, including recruitment communications, development of activists and campaigning around issues.

Mapping is a very useful tool for recruiting and developing activists. The information you gather can tell you:

- who is supportive of the union, 
- who the natural leaders are, 
- which staff could be persuaded if approached, 
- who is anti-union and 
- what the issues are in that area

This gives you a framework for identifying members who are most likely to get active or help in each workplace and who the committee thinks would be useful to have involved.

**Social mapping**

Every workplace has its social groupings of colleagues and friends. Whether it’s the smokers, those who go to the gym together, those who started the job together or those who get the same bus in, people bond together for all sorts of reasons. Being aware of these groups is an important aspect of any organising effort.

### Identifying leaders

Each group has its opinion makers, its natural organisers, its instigators. They are not always the loudest or most talkative, but they are the ones the others listen to and respect. You will have gone a long way if you win over these natural leaders.

Let’s say that you have an important message to communicate, but you don’t have the time or resources to reach every one of your fellow workers. If you can reach the natural leaders in the informal work groups and get them on your side, you can bet that the word will get around to everyone. Once leaders have been identified and agree to co-operate, it is possible to develop a network which can exert considerable power and influence.

Informal work groups also have the advantage of creating certain loyalties among their members. You can draw on this loyalty to figure out unified strategies for problems and take advantage of people’s natural tendency to stick up for those who are close to them.

Besides working with the group leaders, it is important to draw in the loners too. More than likely, their apathy, isolation, or maybe anti-union ideas stem from personal feelings of powerlessness and fear. If collective action can be pulled off successfully and a sense of security established through the group’s action, fear and feelings of impotence can be reduced.

If you have got a particularly tough character in your workplace who seriously threatens unity, don’t be afraid to use the social pressures that work groups can bring to bear to get that person back in line. This applies to supervisory personnel too, especially the supervisor who likes to think they are everyone’s pal.

### One on one conversations

Almost every experienced activist agrees that "The most important thing about organising is personal one-to-one discussion."

Leaflets are necessary, meetings are important, rallies are wonderful, but none of them will ever take the place of one-on-one discussion.

Frequently, when you have simply listened to one of your fellow workers and heard what is on his or her mind, you have won them over because you are the only one who will listen. When you talk to Linda at the next desk and overcome her fears, answer her questions, lift her morale, invite her to the meeting or take her to the rally - that is what organising is all about.

Be careful not to preach, exhort or "sell" the union. Aim to follow the 70/30 principle: Spend 70 percent of the time listening and no more than 30 percent of the time speaking.

**Asking questions**

Open questions, i.e. questions that cannot be answered with “yes” or “no” can be used to:

- Gather information
- Build the conversation
- Explore issues

Use closed questions only when you need to:

- Confirm information you have been given
- Gain commitment to join the union or participate in an activity
- Bring the conversation to a close

**Key points**

- What is your goal for the conversation?
- “Personalise and collectivise”
- Initiating the conversation – what is active listening?
- Repeating things back
- Open body language
- Use names
- Now is the time for colleagues to ‘rant’; group meetings are time to talk of collective grievances and activity
- Dealing with potential negative responses

### Organising around an issue

We want to do two things on the job at the same time: build organisation and improve conditions. We could do these separately. For instance, we could build organisation with no plan to improve conditions, like setting up a poker night or a knitting circle. Or we could try to improve conditions without building organisation, by bribing or kissing up to the supervisor. Neither of those has much to do with being a union. Being a union means union builds organisation by improving conditions, or improves conditions by building organisation.

List the issues people want improved and who has control over each issue. List the lowest level boss with decision-making power on each issue. Generally speaking, the lower they are on the food-chain, the less it will take to make them do what you want. This is important early on when you are working with a small group of active members. Five people in one area probably won't win much for all 300 people in the office.

But they could win improvements in that office that can be used to recruit more people in order to take on bigger issues and do more outreach. That's building organisation.

### Taking action

To build organisation and improve conditions we have to take actions on the job. Action is the oxygen of a union. Ask, “Who has the power to change this issue?” For instance, the manager of a team can't control pensions or pay, but they can control how they enforce policy on toilet breaks and how they treat employees.

Early in a campaign it's useful to focus on what could be called emotional actions or emotional pressure. Work is a headache for us, and to a lesser degree it's headache for our bosses. Generally it's more of a headache for the boss the lower they are on the food-chain at work. Emotional action is when we offer our boss a choice: make work less of a headache for us or we will make work more of a headache for the boss. This is easier the lower the level of the boss. If the boss is a supervisor we see every day, then they will care more about our opinions and how we treat them.

When we collectively confront the boss about conditions make our lives unpleasant, we give the boss an unpleasant experience. Think of this as sharing the wealth of misery that our jobs give us. By giving the boss a taste of their own medicine, making the boss take a helping of what our jobs force on us, we can start to force the boss to make small improvements on the job. That in turn helps us explain to our co-workers that we can improve our jobs by organising together, and that if even more people get involved we can win even bigger improvements.

### Anatomy of a campaign

1.	Issue - What is the problem?
2.	Demand - How can it be solved?
3.	Target - Who can give us what we want?
4.	Tactics - What do we do to exert the pressure to concede?
5.	Participants - Who is involved? What roles do they play?
6.	Witnesses - Today’s witnesses = tomorrow’s participants
7.	Results – Did we win or lose? What is the effect on management?
8.	Follow up – Evaluate the action and discuss next steps.
9.	Escalation / retaliation – Intensify campaigning if necessary, be prepared for management kick back

Your escalation plan needs to be in place from the beginning - How do you escalate activity if demands aren’t met?

## Replace yourself

The primary task of an organiser is to build more organisers and the way to do this is to constantly replace yourself. Here's a few easy ways to help build your successors:

Reveal your sources so others can think with you. Telling others where you got an idea from demonstrates that you think of them as equals. You also provide an opportunity for them question your sources.
Show others how it's done and take them through the process. Pass on the technical know-how so others can be 'experts' just like you.

Encourage people because you believe in them and you know they can do it. You run faster for coaches that want to win. We've got to show that what we do matters and that we believe in each other.

Ask people to do things that are difficult. Move them to take on responsibilities outside their comfort level. We need to help others break out and step up. It's a sign of respect to ask people to do difficult things.

Train your replacement for an officer position. If we train new officers properly and regularly, we can avoid crust and dust in our leadership structures.

Encourage other members to read what you've read. In making trade union history and principles accessible, you cut down on the knowledge monopoly and pass on valuable lessons and experiences.

Introduce people to each other and have them exchange phone numbers. By introducing and ensuring info exchange, you avoid 'Old Boys Clubs' and now information doesn't have to go through you.

The task that we have as reps is to build working class leaders everywhere we go. We are constantly looking for opportunities to teach others what we know so that they could do what we do without us.
