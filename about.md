# Who we are

We are activists who believe that PCS needs to reconnect with its members in order to build a strong, effective union. Our Network is a new initiative whose aim is to argue for a different way of organising in the workplace, to put those ideas into practice, and to hopefully transform the union.

# The union we need

We stand for a union which:
- Takes a direct lead from members in all negotiations;
- Gives members the right to elect and to recall all officials who negotiate on their behalf;
- Has workers’ representatives on a worker’s wage;
- Organises in-house and outsourced workers together;
- Fights not just to stop things getting worse but for radical improvements in our working conditions;
- Builds for imaginative, effective action to win real victories.

# Building a movement

Moving from the kind of union that we currently have to the one we wish to see will not happen overnight. We need to expand our network across as many branches as possible. This will allow us to support each other in our organising, improving PCS’s strength on the ground and boosting the confidence of members whilst ensuring that no branch is left isolated to fend for itself. If you want to get involved, [contact us](mailto:hello@pcsrankandfile.com). We welcome the involvement of all PCS members who support what we are trying to achieve.
