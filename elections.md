<h1 class="section-heading centered">Candidates standing on the rank and file platform</h1>

The PCS Rank & File Network is an organising forum rather than an electoral faction. We welcome the support and involvement of anybody who genuinely wishes to help build a fighting rank and file movement in our union, including those who may otherwise be active in the unionâ€™s various factions.

However, we do recognise the benefit of having those who support our aims in various elected posts in the union. At election times, we will therefore promote the candidacy of our members contesting such elections.
