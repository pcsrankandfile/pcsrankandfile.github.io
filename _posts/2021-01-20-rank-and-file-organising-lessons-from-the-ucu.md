At the first of our online meetings on rank and file organising, activists from the UCU union talk about their experiences of rank and file organising, including the limits of 'Gradyism'.

Strongly supported university strikes over pensions galvanised a whole new layer of activists for the UCU, whose anger at what was seen as a sell-out deal galvanised moves for significant democratic reform and saw Jo Grady elected as General Secretary on a landslide.

However, electing one person - even to the highest post in the union - is no guarantee of change. Activists from the UCU discussed their experiences over the past period, the lessons that can be learned from it both in their union and across the movement, and what's needed to build a truly transformative rank and file movement within and across unions.
