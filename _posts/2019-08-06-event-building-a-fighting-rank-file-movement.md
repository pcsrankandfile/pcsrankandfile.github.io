We are hosting this summit in support of our aim to link up and support lay union members who want to build the capacity of the rank and file membership to take collective action: with the support of the union leadership where possible, and without it where necessary. The full day event includes debate, discussion and a practical training session on direct action in the workplace.

The schedule below will be updated as more details are confirmed.
