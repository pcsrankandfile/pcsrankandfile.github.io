Throwback to my very first picket line‬ 😂

‪I’ve chosen to run for GEC this year, not a decision I came to lightly considering my caring responsibilities but‬ I strongly believe everyone should have a voice & a right to have it heard. I want a union that is an inclusive environment where debate is welcomed and everyone’s opinion is valued. ‬

I decided I can either sit at my desk and moan about how things are ran 🤷‍♀️ or I can get involved and try to make a difference no matter how small ❤️

I would stress that any person who puts their name forward for GEC is worthy of a vote due to the amount of personal commitment it involves. I have a great deal of respect for many of the current GEC that have chose to stand again.

That said, I do feel there is now a complete domination of one political faction and this in my view, is not healthy and has silenced the views of certain individuals. I feel it is appropriate to challenge this and open the debate to a wider range of views to achieve, ultimately - a more democratic Union.

I would appreciate your support when the time comes to nominate at AGM and vote in this years HMRC GEC.

Please also consider voting for the other Rank and File Candidates who are running this year ❤️✊
